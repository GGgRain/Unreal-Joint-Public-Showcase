 * Joint node is a most basic form of the node that can be placed on the Joint manager graph.

 * Joint nodes and fragments are the amalgam of the executable action (function) and storage.
 * Each node can contain the data you need for the graph and can be accessed from the other nodes.
 * And also can be used to implement some special action on the graph that will be executed when this node started to being played.
 * Notice that the nodes are executed only when the Joint flow met the node. but at the same time, you can still access any nodes in the graph if you want and use its variables.
 * 
 * You can override this class (more specifically UJointFragment) to represent some additional features for your graph or variables for the graph.

	 * BeginPlay literally means starting the playback of a node, activating its activity, and executing its functionality.
	 * The default BeginPlay of a Joint node propagates BeginPlay to its child sub-nodes.
	 * Therefore, when the top-level node starts playing, its child sub-nodes will play together unless they implement different functionalities.

	 * EndPlay literally means ending the playback of a node, deactivating its activity.
	 * Similarly, the default EndPlay of a Joint node propagates EndPlay to its child sub-nodes.
	 * When the playback of the top-level node ends, its child sub-nodes must also end playback together, and their activities are turned off.
	 * Unlike BeginPlay, there's a slight difference with EndPlay because once the playback of the top-level node ends, the Joint proceeds to the next node anyway. The functionalities of a sub-node should strictly operate within that node.
	 * 
	 * These functions are helpful for controlling the node externally or for checking the node's lifecycle. If EndPlay or BeginPlay is called externally, it forcibly plays or stops the child nodes, which greatly aids in external node control.
	 * The synchronization between the execution of parent nodes and child nodes is crucial because, in most cases, child nodes depend on parent nodes or complement the functionality of parent nodes. Hence, it's preferred to follow the same lifecycle.
	 * However, when ending the playback of a node internally, the following points should be considered:
	 * 1. The parent node should not end if the child nodes still have pending tasks.
	 * 2. The parent node can only end when all child nodes are ready to be ended.
	 * 
	 * To address these rules, PendingEndPlay was introduced. If the PendingEndPlay flag is active, it indicates that the child nodes are ready to end their tasks at any time.
	 * 
	 * In the Joint Node's default class, MarkNodePendingIfNeeded, marks itself as PendingEndPlay when all child nodes are marked as PendingEndPlay.
	 * When a child node is marked as PendingEndPlay, it calls this on its parent node.
	 * Unless overridden to implement different functionalities, the parent node will also be marked as PendingEndPlay when all its sub-nodes are marked as PendingEndPlay.
	 * When the top-level sub-node is marked as PendingEndPlay, the Joint node enters the EndPlay state.
	 * In essence, PendingEndPlay is a flag added for internal playback control, unlike EndPlay and BeginPlay, which are for external control.

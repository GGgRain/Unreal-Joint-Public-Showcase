## :mag: About

**Joint Public Showcase** is a public Unreal Engine project that demonstrates how to use **Joint**, a general-purpose modular playback framework, in real, practical scenarios.

This repository focuses on:

* Demonstrating **best practices** for using Joint and its derivative plugins
* Providing **playable and inspectable examples**
* Showcasing **experimental features** (WIP)

It serves as a living sandbox rather than a reusable plugin.

> [!TIP]
> This project provides Joint and Joint Native by itself - so you don't need to install them manually.
